    "The main focus of [our course](https://courses.cs.sfu.ca/2016sp-cmpt-733-g2/pages/Lecture_Notes) is on data analytics. In fact, however, there are many other exciting topics about Big Data, which we cannot cover due to time constraints. In Lecture 8, I gave you a brief overview of AWS and Visualization. In Assignment 8, I designed some tasks aiming to deepen your understanding. After completing this assignment, you should be able to answer the following questions:"

In this assignment, we are going to learn Data-driven Documents (D3), one of the most popular ones. D3 is a JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data. People may choose to use D3 for various reasons. What I like most about D3 is that it makes the creation of __dynamic__ data visualizations on the Web become much easier. In Part 2, you will learn three methods: __\"transition\", \"selection.exit\", and \"selection.on\"__ for turning a static visualization into a dynamic one. "
